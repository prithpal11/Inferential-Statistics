# Data Analysis Project # 2

**Dataset filename:** gss.RData

Project for online course on 'Inferential Statistics', Duke University. 

This was course 2 of 5 under the 'Statistics with R Specialization'.

# Dataset Information:

The dataset from General Social Survey (GSS) was provided for this analysis.

Since 1972, GSS has been monitoring societal change and studying the growing complexity of American society. The GSS aims to gather data on contemporary American society in order to monitor and explain trends and constants in attitudes, behaviors, and attributes; to examine the structure and functioning of society in general as well as the role played by relevant subgroups; to compare the United States to other societies in order to place American society in comparative perspective and develop cross-national models of human society; and to make high-quality data easily accessible to scholars, students, policy makers, and others, with minimal cost and waiting.

GSS questions cover a diverse range of issues including national spending priorities, marijuana use, crime and punishment, race relations, quality of life, confidence in institutions, and sexual behavior.

# Project Objective:

**R program file:** stat_inf_project.rmd

The Project objective consisted of 2 parts:
1. Identifying 3 research questions based on the GSS database & use data analysis principles to help answer them.
2. All analysis were to be completed using the R programming language via RStudio, along with its write-up as an R Markdown document.
